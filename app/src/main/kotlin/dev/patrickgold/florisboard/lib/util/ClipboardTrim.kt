/**
 * Trims the padding off text on its way into the clipboard (issue #335).
 *
 * Selecting by hand is imprecise: the handles catch the space before a word, or the line break after the
 * last one, and that padding then travels into every place the clip is pasted. On by default, and
 * switchable off under Settings → Clipboard.
 *
 * Two rules keep it from ever being surprising:
 *
 * * **Only the ends.** Whatever the selection holds between its first and last visible character is
 *   copied exactly as it was, line breaks and double spaces included.
 * * **A selection of nothing but whitespace is left alone.** Someone who selects three spaces and copies
 *   them means those three spaces; trimming would put an empty clip on the clipboard instead, which is
 *   not a shorter version of what they asked for but a different thing entirely.
